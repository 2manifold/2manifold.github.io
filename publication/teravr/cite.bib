	abstract = {Neuron morphology is recognized as a key determinant of cell type, yet the quantitative profiling of a mammalian neuron{\textquoteright}s complete three-dimensional (3-D) morphology remains arduous when the neuron has complex arborization and long projection. Whole-brain reconstruction of neuron morphology is even more challenging as it involves processing tens of teravoxels of imaging data. Validating such reconstructions is extremely laborious. We developed TeraVR, an open-source virtual reality annotation system, to address these challenges. TeraVR integrates immersive and collaborative 3-D visualization, interaction, and hierarchical streaming of teravoxel-scale images. Using TeraVR, we produced precise 3-D full morphology of long-projecting neurons in whole mouse brains and developed a collaborative workflow for highly accurate neuronal reconstruction.},
